If you want to run only the Front-end, please run `npm install` to install the dependencies, then use `npm run dev`.


If you want to run the Back-end and the Front-end, change the `VITE_BASE_URL` to localhost in the `.env` on the root folder, install the dependencies on the root folder and in the backend folder, then create a .env on your backend folder, create the following variables (adjust as you wish):
JWT_SECRET
MONGO_URI
PORT
then, use `npm run start`.

Please note that the database access is not public; you can make your own database using MongoDB, or anything else.
